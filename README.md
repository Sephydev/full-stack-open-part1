# Full Stack Open Part 1 Exercises

This repository is the solution I've made during the different exercises of the part 1 of the curriculum of Full Stack Open.
All the exercises are made with the framework React.
Course Information was the first exercise to make. It consist of a "list" of paragraph describing a course. It was used by the curriculum to see the base of React, notably the components.
Unicafe was the second exercise and focused more on event listener and useState. It consisted of a notation system, with different statistics changing in real time when the vote was modified.
Anecdotes is the third and last exercise. Like unicafe, it was focused on event listener and useState. It consist of a random generator with a vote system. The second section display the anecdote with the most vote.
